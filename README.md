 # Dual-MCU_Ender-3v2_Klipper
 The config files I am experimenting with for my modded Creality Ender-3 v2 running Klipper.
 
 I want to use z axis tilt  ability but am limited by the stock Creality 4.2.2 mainboard. 
 To resolve this, I have opted to add a new mainboard to the printer which will handle all
 axis movements (X, Y, Za, & Zb) while the original mainboard will be relegated to as an auxboard
 to control the extruder. 
 
 I have plans to add an Enraged Rabbit Carrot (ERCF), conversion from dual leadscrew to
 dual belt driven Z, and adding IDEX capabilities. Toolhead0 will be fed by the ERCF and toolhead1
 will use a water dissolvable filament for supports.
